## 📌 JIRA Progress Tracker

I’m actively managing this GRC project in JIRA using a Kanban board.

Current JIRA work items include:
- BOA-1 – System Overview
- BOA-2 – Risk Register Setup
- BOA-3 – Access Controls Review
- BOA-4 – Risk Table Documentation
- BOA-5 – POA&M Creation

🛠️ Screenshots or links to JIRA tasks can be provided upon request while I continue to integrate both systems.

⚠️ I’m learning GitHub and JIRA side-by-side, and I’ll expand this section with direct integration or exported logs once I’m more comfortable. This is a work in progress—and that’s the point.
